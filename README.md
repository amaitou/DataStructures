# Data Structures & Algorithms

- ### **Data Structures**

    Data structures are ways to organize, store, and manage data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They are the foundation for designing efficient algorithms and play a crucial role in computer science.

    Common data structures include:

    - **Arrays**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.

    - **Linked Lists**: A linear collection of data elements where each element points to the next.

    - **Stacks**: A collection of elements that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

    - **Queues**: A collection of elements that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

    - **Trees**: A hierarchical structure with nodes, with a root node and child nodes forming a parent-child relationship.

    - **Graphs**: A collection of nodes connected by edges.
    Hash Tables: A data structure that provides fast access to elements by using a hash function to map keys to values.

- ### **Algorithms**

    Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a problem or completing a task. In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions that take an input and transform it into an output through a series of well-defined steps.

    Key aspects of algorithms include:

    - **Correctness**: Ensuring the algorithm produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

    - **Efficiency**: Minimizing the time and space resources required to execute the algorithm.

    - **Complexity**: Analyzing the time complexity (how the runtime increases with input size) and space complexity (how the memory usage increases with input size).

In this repository, I tried to implement a few of the data structures and some searching and sorting algorithms using different programming and scripting languages, feel free to check each one of them
