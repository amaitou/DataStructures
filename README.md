# Data Structures & Algorithms

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways.

## Running an algorithm implementation

I wrote these algorithms using different programming languages, some of them need to be compiled like c++, but the other scripting languages such as (Python, Javascript) you can run them using their interpreters e.g :

* C++ 

```bash
g++ <AlgorithmName.cpp> -o <AlgorithmName>
```
* Python3

```python
python3 <AlgorithmName.py>
```
* Javascript

```javascript
node <AlgorithmName.js>
```
